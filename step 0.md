Welcome to my first PBL (problem-based learning) project! As I continue to develop my Linux Administration skills and pursue my goal of becoming a Linux Systems Engineer, it's essential that I am able to showcase my skills outside of certifications

As a Linux/DevOps engineer, everything you do is around websites, applications, software, etc. There are also different stack technologies that make different solutions possible. These "stacks" of technologies are regarded as **WEB STACKS** 

A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This project will showcase the **LAMP** (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP or Python or Perl) stack.

This project helped further develop my Linux skills and reinforce the skills I have already learned. It also forced me to work outside of my knowledge and refer to the good ol' Google! 
Constructing a correct search query and sifting through information that can lead to a proper solution is a valuable skill that is very beneficial. 


# Step 0 - Preparing prerequisites

1. Setup AWS account and provision an Ubuntu Server
2. Connect to EC2 Instance
3. Save private key and make sure it's secure!
4. Download SSH agent (I chose Terminus)
5. Connect to the instance by running
```
ssh -i <private-key-name>.pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>

```
And just like that my first Linux Server in the cloud is created! The set up looks like this
